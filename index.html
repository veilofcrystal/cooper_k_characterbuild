                        Jemaine is a guy who plays guitar, and always is searching for love in all the wrong places. He should look in the mirror instead because he truely is in love with himself. This is why he has the best breakups of the series.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="lb_text">
                            His best moments are definately in the episode where he channels his inner David bowie, and the episode where he dates an Australian girl.

                            Bret is the bass player of Flight of the Conchords. He arguably has the best hair out of the two, but his relationship skills are just as bad as Jemaines... He is in love with himself but not nearly as much in comparison. He does however have what seems to be a bit of a better moral compas and sometimes makes the better decisions.

                            <p class="lb_text">
                                His best moments are definately in the episode where he makes his own camera phone, and the episode where he works as a sign flipper and becomes the "Boom King" .

                                    Murray is the manager of the Flight of the Concords. He is their relable loyal manager who has minimal resources but does his best and never looses faith in Bret and Jemaines band.He frequently holds band meetings in the office he works at. Best known for his New Zealand posters. (Actually he might have the best hair...)

                                    His best moments are all of them. He is probably my favorite character. All of his moments are great.

                                   Mel is the Flight of the Concords BIGGEST FAN. Possibly only fan. She is a borderline stalker, and wants so desperately to be a groupie however neither Bret or Jemaine are interested in her. They're more so terrified of her.

                                       Her best moments are in the episodes where she paints a portrait of Bret and Jemaine as conjoined twins, and the one where Bret and Jemaine take trippy paper and have strange halucinations with her in them.
