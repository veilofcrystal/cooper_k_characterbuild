homework # 2 multimedia authoring

    I have decided to make my Character build based on the characters of the show "Flight of the concords".

    The color scheme will be as psychedellic as possible, I belive thats what Jemaine and Bret would have wanted...

    The background will be animated to change colours. 

    I want to put a video in the background of the navigation from the music video "Bowie's in space" we'll see if i can figure it out. There will sadly be no audio because Justin (the professor) has requested that there not be any audio...Which is fine...I suppose... 

    I hope you enjoy the strange things my brain creates...
